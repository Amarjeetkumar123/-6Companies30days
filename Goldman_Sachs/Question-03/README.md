# Question 03

The idea is:

1. The ZERO comes from 10.
2. The 10 comes from 2 x 5
3. And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. likes 4ร5 = 20 ...
So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10

Example ๐
By given number 4617.

5^1 : 4617 รท 5 = 923.4, so we get 923 factors of 5

5^2 : 4617 รท 25 = 184.68, so we get 184 additional factors of 5

5^3 : 4617 รท 125 = 36.936, so we get 36 additional factors of 5

5^4 : 4617 รท 625 = 7.3872, so we get 7 additional factors of 5

5^5 : 4617 รท 3125 = 1.47744, so we get 1 more factor of 5

5^6 : 4617 รท 15625 = 0.295488, which is less than 1, so stop here.

Then 4617! has 923 + 184 + 36 + 7 + 1 = 1151 trailing zeroes.
